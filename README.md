flutter: Flutter framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.
Custom widgets for text fields and form elements.
External services (Firebase, SFTP) to upload and store data.


Usage
On app launch, if the user has already submitted data, the form will load with their previously submitted details.
Users can fill in the form and submit their details by pressing the Save button. If the form is already populated, users can update their details.
The data is saved as a PDF on the server, and the user can update or delete the document.
All actions (submit, update, delete) are processed via backend services integrated with Firebase and SFTP.

Core Functionality
Data Submission: Upon successful form validation, the data is sent to a server where a PDF is generated, stored, and uploaded.
Data Retrieval: On app start, the previously saved data is loaded into the form fields, allowing users to update or delete their information.
PDF Generation: A userâ€™s details are formatted into a PDF file using a third-party service, and uploaded to both Firebase and an SFTP server.
Backend Integration
The app integrates with external services for data management:

Firebase: Used to store the user's data and the generated PDF.
SFTP Server: The PDF is uploaded to an SFTP server.
Custom Services: The project uses a custom service layer (lib/services/common_services.dart) to handle all backend communication.
